How to Build SensSoft Docker Containers
---------------------------------------

1. Install [``Docker``](http://docker.com) on your machine. Requires Docker 1.7 and above.

1. Install ``docker-compose`` in an virtual environment. 
   Full instructions can be found [``here``](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
   
   ```bash
   $ python3 -m venv env
   $ source env/bin/activate
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

1. Before launching the Docker containers, ensure your ``vm_max_map_count`` 
   kernel setting is set to at least 262144.
   Visit [``Running Elasticsearch in Production mode``](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.5/docker.html#docker-cli-run-prod-mode) for OS specific instructions.
   
   ```bash
   # Example for Linux systems
   $ sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
   ```

1. Start Elasticsearch. Give Elasticsearch about 2 minutes to start before confirming
   its state. 
   
   ```bash
   $ docker-compose up -d loadbalancer
   ```

1. Confirm state:
   ```bash
   $ curl -XGET http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty
    {
     "cluster_name" : "SensSoft",
     "status" : "green",
     "timed_out" : false,
     "number_of_nodes" : 1,
     "number_of_data_nodes" : 1,
     "active_primary_shards" : 0,
     "active_shards" : 0,
     "relocating_shards" : 0,
     "initializing_shards" : 0,
     "unassigned_shards" : 0,
     "delayed_unassigned_shards" : 0,
     "number_of_pending_tasks" : 0,
     "number_of_in_flight_fetch" : 0,
     "task_max_waiting_in_queue_millis" : 0,
     "active_shards_percent_as_number" : 100.0
   }
   ```
 
1. Launch logging server. Give Logstash about 2 minutes to start before confirming 
   its state.
  
   ```bash
   $ docker-compose up -d logstash
   $ curl -XGET http://localhost:8100 
   ok
   ```
   
1. Before Kibana can be used, we will need to generate some data. We have already 
   provided an example instrumented website to assist.
   
   ```bash
   $ docker-compose up -d site
   ```

   Visit `http://localhost:8080` and you will see Apache SensSoft's home page.
   
1. Launch Kibana. Give Kibana about 2-5 minutes to start before accessing
   `http://localhost:5601`. 
   
   ```bash
   $ docker-compose up -d kibana
   ```

1. Register an index in Kibana to see the logs:

   Goto: Management -> Index Patterns and enter `userale` in the Index pattern box.
   Choose `clientTime` in the drop down `Time Filter field name` field.
  
   ![alt text][configure_index]
   
1. Load example Dashboard and Visualizations under docker/kibana/.

   Goto: Management -> Saved Objects and select the `Import` button. Import the
   `visualizations.json` and `dashboard.json` file.

   ![alt text][management]

   Confirm index conflicts if message appears. 
   
   ![alt text][confirmation]
   
   Once that is complete, navigate to the `Dashboard` view in Kibana and click the
   `Apache SensSoft Dashboard` object.

1. To Launch Tap and Distill
   ```bash
   $ docker-compose up -d distill tap
   ```
   
1. To stop all containers.
    ```bash
    $ docker-compose stop
    ```
 
Having Issues?
--------------
1. Check out the docker-compose logs for the service(s) that are having issues.

   ```bash
   $ docker-compose ps 
   ```
1. Make sure to send us the docker-compose logs to help diagnose your issues please!
   
   ```bash
   $ docker-compose logs > err.dump 
   ```
